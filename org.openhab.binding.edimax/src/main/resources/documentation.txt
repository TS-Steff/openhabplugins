First configure following in openhab.cfg

1. This binding features some discoverers.

1.1. The UDPDiscoverer sends UDP broadcast messages which Edimax will respond to. This discoverer is used by default.

1.2. If for some reasons you cannot use the UDPDiscoverer there is another discovery method that scans an IP segment for the devices.
In order to use this discoverer you therefore use the 'ipprefix' to configure the first part of the net.
Next you specify 'ipStartSegment' and 'ipEndSegment' both as numbers. These 3 configurations make
up an IP range in which the discovery checks for devices.

Example section of openhab.cfg:
################################ Edimax Binding #######################################
#
# Edimax binding
edimax:ipprefix=192.168.2.
edimax:ipStartSegment=100
edimax:ipEndSegment=120


2. Next you configure your device itself.
Simple version is to just configure the mac adress. The item is considered to be a switch, which
than is ON or OFF.
Example: Switch EdimaxSimple  {edimax="01234567ABCD"}

There is also the option to configure the type, available types are STATE,POWER and CURRENT.
Where STATE is the default behaviour, POWER for example assumes a number item and will assign
the power consumption to this item.
Example: Number EdimaxCurrent  {edimax="01234567ABCD:CURRENT"}
Number EdimaxCurrent  {edimax="01234567ABCD:CURRENT"}

3. TODO it uses the default connection credentials.
